0		no one can doubt the filmmakers' motives , but the guys still feels counterproductive . 
0		the following things are not at all entertaining : the bad sound , the lack of climax and , worst of all , watching seinfeld ( who is also one of the film's producers ) do everything he can to look like a good guy . 
0		entertains not so much because of its music or comic antics , but through the perverse pleasure of watching disney scrape the bottom of its own cracker barrel . 
0		instead of trying to bust some blondes , [diggs] should be probing why a guy with his talent ended up in a movie this bad . 
0		it's all gratuitous before long , as if schwentke were fulfilling a gross-out quota for an anticipated audience demographic instead of shaping the material to fit the story . 
0		the action switches between past and present , but the material link is too tenuous to anchor the emotional connections that purport to span a 125-year divide . 
0		 . . . a preachy parable stylized with a touch of john woo bullet ballet . 
0		a generic bloodbath that often becomes laughably unbearable when it isn't merely offensive . 
0		a film which presses familiar herzog tropes into the service of a limpid and conventional historical fiction , when really what we demand of the director is to be mesmerised . 
0		a sugar-coated rocky whose valuable messages are forgotten 10 minutes after the last trombone honks . 
0		an earnest racial-issues picture that might have gotten respectful critical praise in a different era -- say , the '60s . 
0		 . . . an hour-and-a-half of inoffensive , unmemorable filler . 
0		belongs in the too-hot-for-tv direct-to-video/dvd category , and this is why i have given it a one-star rating . 
0		a movie you observe , rather than one you enter into . 
0		scarlet diva has a voyeuristic tug , but all in all it's a lot less sensational than it wants to be . 
0		tadpole is emblematic of the witless ageism afflicting films : young is cool , and too young is too cool . 
0		the biggest problem with roger avary's uproar against the mpaa is that , even in all its director's cut glory , he's made a film that's barely shocking , barely interesting and most of all , barely anything . 
0		long on twinkly-eyed close-ups and short on shame . 
0		[siegel] and co-writers lisa bazadona and grace woodard have relied too much on convention in creating the characters who surround frankie . 
0		the christ allegory doesn't work because there is no foundation for it
0		a shame that stealing harvard is too busy getting in its own way to be anything but frustrating , boring , and forgettable . 
0		the ethos of the chelsea hotel may shape hawke's artistic aspirations , but he hasn't yet coordinated his own dv poetry with the beat he hears in his soul . 
0		while there's likely very little crossover appeal to those without much interest in the elizabethans ( as well as rank frustration from those in the know about rubbo's dumbed-down tactics ) , much ado about something is an amicable endeavor . 
0		the documentary is much too conventional -- lots of boring talking heads , etc . -- to do the subject matter justice . 
0		the good girl is a film in which the talent is undeniable but the results are underwhelming . 
0		i'm sorry to say that this should seal the deal - arnold is not , nor will he be , back . 
0		although trying to balance self-referential humor and a normal ol' slasher plot seemed like a decent endeavor , the result doesn't fully satisfy either the die-hard jason fans or those who can take a good joke . 
0		a listless sci-fi comedy in which eddie murphy deploys two guises and elaborate futuristic sets to no particularly memorable effect . 
0		despite apparent motives to the contrary , it ends up being , like [seinfeld's] revered tv show , about pretty much nothing . 
0		contains all the substance of a twinkie -- easy to swallow , but scarcely nourishing . 
0		the movie is so contrived , nonsensical and formulaic that , come to think of it , the day-old shelf would be a more appropriate location to store it . 
0		i loved looking at this movie . i just didn't care as much for the story . 
0		if legendary shlockmeister ed wood had ever made a movie about a vampire , it probably would look a lot like this alarming production , adapted from anne rice's novel the vampire chronicles . 
0		too much of this well-acted but dangerously slow thriller feels like a preamble to a bigger , more complicated story , one that never materializes . 
0		is anyone else out there getting tired of the whole slo-mo , double-pistoled , ballistic-pyrotechnic hong kong action aesthetic ? 
0		unless you come in to the film with a skateboard under your arm , you're going to feel like you weren't invited to the party . 
0		fear permeates the whole of stortelling , todd solondz' oftentimes funny , yet ultimately cowardly autocritique . 
0		it's all surface psychodramatics . 
0		uncommonly stylish but equally silly . . . the picture fails to generate much suspense , nor does it ask searching enough questions to justify its pretensions . 
0		this is so bad . 
0		stephen earnhart's documentary is a decomposition of healthy eccentric inspiration and ambition  wearing a cloak of unsentimental , straightforward text  when it's really an exercise in gross romanticization of the delusional personality type . 
0		no , i don't know why steven seagal is considered a star , nor why he keeps being cast in action films when none of them are ever any good or make any money . 
0		message movie or an action-packed submarine spectacular ? alas , it's neither . 
0		a slight and obvious effort , even for one whose target demographic is likely still in the single digits , age-wise . 
0		offers very little genuine romance and even fewer laughs . . . a sad sitcom of a movie , largely devoid of charm . 
0		exists then as an occasionally insightful acting exercise . 
0		the script is too mainstream and the psychology too textbook to intrigue . 
0		there's an audience for it , but it could have been funnier and more innocent . 
0		laughably , irredeemably awful . 
0		weiss and speck never make a convincing case for the relevance of these two 20th-century footnotes . 
0		breen's script is sketchy with actorish notations on the margin of acting . 
0		how do you make a movie with depth about a man who lacked any ? on the evidence before us , the answer is clear : not easily and , in the end , not well enough . 
0		what was once original has been co-opted so frequently that it now seems pedestrian . 
0		a great ending doesn't make up for a weak movie , and crazy as hell doesn't even have a great ending . 
0		the emperor's club is one of those films that possesses all the good intentions in the world , but . . . 
0		this rough trade punch-and-judy act didn't play well then and it plays worse now . 
0		walsh can't quite negotiate the many inconsistencies in janice's behavior or compensate for them by sheer force of charm . 
0		the bland outweighs the nifty , and cletis tout never becomes the clever crime comedy it thinks it is . 
0		this miserable excuse of a movie runs on empty , believing flatbush machismo will get it through . 
0		the ending is a cop-out . what happens to john q ? i don't have an i am sam clue . 
0		it's a pedestrian , flat drama that screams out 'amateur' in almost every frame . 
0		portentous and pretentious , the weight of water is appropriately titled , given the heavy-handedness of it drama . 
0		self-congratulatory , misguided , and ill-informed , if nonetheless compulsively watchable . 
0		you have no affinity for most of the characters . nothing about them is attractive . what they see in each other also is difficult to fathom . 
0		in addition to sporting one of the worst titles in recent cinematic history , ballistic : ecks vs . sever also features terrible , banal dialogue ; convenient , hole-ridden plotting ; superficial characters and a rather dull , unimaginative car chase . 
0		there are plenty of scenes in frida that do work , but rarely do they involve the title character herself . 
0		an empty shell of an epic rather than the real deal . 
0		the acting by the over-25s lacks spark , with csokas particularly unconnected . 
0		an instantly forgettable snow-and-stuntwork extravaganza that likely will be upstaged by an avalanche of more appealing holiday-season product . 
0		even a hardened voyeur would require the patience of job to get through this interminable , shapeless documentary about the swinging subculture . 
0		if you pitch your expectations at an all time low , you could do worse than this oddly cheerful -- but not particularly funny -- body-switching farce . 
0		flaccid drama and exasperatingly slow journey . 
0		works on the whodunit level as its larger themes get lost in the murk of its own making
0		the movie wavers between hallmark card sentimentality and goofy , life-affirming moments straight out of a cellular phone commercial . 
0		needless to say , the dramatics that follow are utter hooey . 
0		one can't shake the feeling that crossroads is nothing more than an hour-and-a-half-long commercial for britney's latest album . 
0		arguably the year's silliest and most incoherent movie . 
0		does little to elaborate the conceit of setting this blood-soaked tragedy of murderous ambition in the era of richard nixon . 
0		basically , it's pretty but dumb . 
0		if welles was unhappy at the prospect of the human race splitting in two , he probably wouldn't be too crazy with his great-grandson's movie splitting up in pretty much the same way . 
0		 . . . unspeakably , unbearably dull , featuring reams of flatly delivered dialogue and a heroine who comes across as both shallow and dim-witted . 
0		can't get enough of libidinous young city dwellers ? try this obscenely bad dark comedy , so crass that it makes edward burns' sidewalks of new york look like oscar wilde . 
0		the master of disguise falls under the category of 'should have been a sketch on saturday night live . '
0		 . . . hudlin is stuck trying to light a fire with soggy leaves . 
0		filled with low-brow humor , gratuitous violence and a disturbing disregard for life . 
0		desperately unfunny when it tries to makes us laugh and desperately unsuspenseful when it tries to make us jump out of our seats . 
0		the acting is fine but the script is about as interesting as a recording of conversations at the wal-mart checkout line . 
0		according to the script , grant and bullock's characters are made for each other . but you'd never guess that from the performances . 
0		call me a cynic , but there's something awfully deadly about any movie with a life-affirming message . 
0		don't hate el crimen del padre amaro because it's anti-catholic . hate it because it's lousy . 
0		although the sequel has all the outward elements of the original , the first film's lovely flakiness is gone , replaced by the forced funniness found in the dullest kiddie flicks . 
0		what we have is a character faced with the possibility that her life is meaningless , vapid and devoid of substance , in a movie that is definitely meaningless , vapid and devoid of substance . 
0		unless bob crane is someone of particular interest to you , this film's impressive performances and adept direction aren't likely to leave a lasting impression . 
0		the dark and bittersweet twist feels strange as things turn nasty and tragic during the final third of the film . first-timer john mckay is never able to pull it back on course . 
0		impeccably filmed , sexually charged , but ultimately lacking in substance , not to mention dragged down by a leaden closing act . 
0		it's a terrible movie in every regard , and utterly painful to watch . 
0		everyone's to blame here . 
0		a wildly inconsistent emotional experience . 
0		the central character isn't complex enough to hold our interest . 
0		a fascinating but choppy documentary . 
0		the execution is so pedestrian that the most positive comment we can make is that rob schneider actually turns in a pretty convincing performance as a prissy teenage girl . 
0		never having seen the first two films in the series , i can't compare friday after next to them , but nothing would change the fact that what we have here is a load of clams left in the broiling sun for a good three days . 
0		the plot grows thin soon , and you find yourself praying for a quick resolution . 
0		broder's screenplay is shallow , offensive and redundant , with pitifully few real laughs . 
0		the screenplay , co-written by director imogen kimmel , lacks the wit necessary to fully exploit the comic elements of the premise , making the proceedings more bizarre than actually amusing . 
0		a limp eddie murphy vehicle that even he seems embarrassed to be part of . 
0		the notion of deleting emotion from people , even in an advanced prozac nation , is so insanely dysfunctional that the rampantly designed equilibrium becomes a concept doofus . 
0		the script is a dim-witted pairing of teen-speak and animal gibberish . 
0		in the end , the movie bogs down in insignificance , saying nothing about kennedy's assassination and revealing nothing about the pathology it pretends to investigate . 
0		the obnoxious special effects , the obligatory outbursts of flatulence and the incessant , so-five-minutes-ago pop music on the soundtrack overwhelm what is left of the scruffy , dopey old hanna-barbera charm . 
0		nicks refuses to let slackers be seen as just another teen movie , which means he can be forgiven for frequently pandering to fans of the gross-out comedy . 
0		dreary tale of middle-class angst
0		no amount of burning , blasting , stabbing , and shooting can hide a weak script . 
0		a sloppy slapstick throwback to long gone bottom-of-the-bill fare like the ghost and mr . chicken . 
0		while the ensemble player who gained notice in guy ritchie's lock , stock and two smoking barrels and snatch has the bod , he's unlikely to become a household name on the basis of his first starring vehicle . 
0		the 70-year-old godard has become , to judge from in praise of love , the sort of bitter old crank who sits behind his light meter and harangues the supposed injustices of the artistic world-at-large without doing all that much to correct them . 
0		 . . . its stupidities wind up sticking in one's mind a lot more than the cool bits . 
0		suffocated at conception by its munchausen-by-proxy mum . punish the vehicle to adore the star . 
0		it's a sometimes interesting remake that doesn't compare to the brilliant original . 
0		a ragbag of promising ideas and failed narrative , of good acting and plain old bad filmmaking . 
0		though it goes further than both , anyone who has seen the hunger or cat people will find little new here , but a tasty performance from vincent gallo lifts this tale of cannibal lust above the ordinary . 
0		a predictable and stereotypical little b-movie . 
0		'christian bale's quinn [is] a leather clad grunge-pirate with a hairdo like gandalf in a wind-tunnel and a simply astounding cor-blimey-luv-a-duck cockney accent . '
0		aggravating and tedious . 
0		not even steven spielberg has dreamed up such blatant and sickening product placement in a movie . 
0		whenever you think you've seen the end of the movie , we cut to a new scene , which also appears to be the end . but , no , we get another scene , and then another . you begin to long for the end credits as the desert does for rain . 
0		beware the quirky brit-com . they can and will turn on a dime from oddly humorous to tediously sentimental . 
0		wins my vote for 'the 2002 enemy of cinema' award . 
0		this is a throwaway , junk-food movie whose rap soundtrack was better tended to than the film itself . 
0		all ends well , sort of , but the frenzied comic moments never click . 
0		the gags , and the script , are a mixed bag . 
0		apparently kissing leads to suicide attempts and tragic deaths . marisa tomei is good , but just a kiss is just a mess . 
0		sad nonsense , this . but not without cheesy fun factor . 
0		nervous breakdowns are not entertaining . 
0		even in the summertime , the most restless young audience deserves the dignity of an action hero motivated by something more than franchise possibilities . 
0		the good is very , very good . . . the rest runs from mildly unimpressive to despairingly awful . 
0		there isn't nearly enough fun here , despite the presence of some appealing ingredients . 
0		i suspect that there are more interesting ways of dealing with the subject . 
0		the movie feels like it's going to be great , and it carries on feeling that way for a long time , but takeoff just never happens . 
0		i'd give real money to see the perpetrators of chicago torn apart by dingoes . 
0		it's dumb , but more importantly , it's just not scary . 
0		this is the kind of movie where people who have never picked a lock do so easily after a few tries and become expert fighters after a few weeks . 
0		equlibrium could pass for a thirteen-year-old's book report on the totalitarian themes of 1984 and farenheit 451 . 
0		manipulative claptrap , a period-piece movie-of-the-week , plain old blarney . . . take your pick . all three descriptions suit evelyn , a besotted and obvious drama that tells us nothing new . 
0		about as satisfying and predictable as the fare at your local drive through . 
0		despite the fact that this film wasn't as bad as i thought it was going to be , it's still not a good movie
0		the heedless impetuousness of youth is on full , irritating display in [this] meandering and pointless french coming-of-age import from writer-director anne-sophie birot . 
0		carrying this wafer-thin movie on his nimble shoulders , chan wades through putrid writing , direction and timing with a smile that says , 'if i stay positive , maybe i can channel one of my greatest pictures , drunken master . '
0		while you have to admit it's semi-amusing to watch robert deniro belt out " when you're a jet , you're a jet all the way , " it's equally distasteful to watch him sing the lyrics to " tonight . " 
0		the film makes strong arguments regarding the social status of america's indigenous people , but really only exists to try to eke out an emotional tug of the heart , one which it fails to get . 
0		when cowering and begging at the feet a scruffy giannini , madonna gives her best performance since abel ferrara had her beaten to a pulp in his dangerous game . 
0		the waterlogged script plumbs uncharted depths of stupidity , incoherence and sub-sophomoric sexual banter . 
0		consists of a plot and jokes done too often by people far more talented than ali g
0		every visual joke is milked , every set-up obvious and lengthy , every punchline predictable . there's no energy . 
0		the movie keeps coming back to the achingly unfunny phonce and his several silly subplots . 
0		it's one pussy-ass world when even killer-thrillers revolve around group therapy sessions . 
0		to imagine the life of harry potter as a martial arts adventure told by a lobotomized woody allen is to have some idea of the fate that lies in store for moviegoers lured to the mediocrity that is kung pow : enter the fist . 
0		i don't think this movie loves women at all . 
0		gorgeous to look at but insufferably tedious and turgid . . . a curiously constricted epic . 
0		when not obscured by the booming bass-heavy soundtrack , the conversation presents the kind of linguistic fumbling not heard since macy gray's game of chinese whispers with mr bean . 
0		the film is a confusing melange of tones and styles , one moment a romantic trifle and the next a turgid drama . 
0		[i]f you've been to more than one indie flick in your life , chances are you've already seen this kind of thing . 
0		 . . . tackling a low-budget movie in which inexperienced children play the two main characters might not be the best way to cut your teeth in the film industry . 
0		one of those so-so films that could have been much better . 
0		kim ki-deok seems to have in mind an ( emotionally at least ) adolescent audience demanding regular shocks and bouts of barely defensible sexual violence to keep it interested . 
0		starts out strongly before quickly losing its focus , point and purpose in a mess of mixed messages , over-blown drama and bruce willis with a scar . 
0		an ambitious , serious film that manages to do virtually everything wrong ; sitting through it is something akin to an act of cinematic penance . 
0		unofficially , national lampoon's van wilder is son of animal house . officially , it is twice as bestial but half as funny . 
0		piccoli's performance is amazing , yes , but the symbols of loss and denial and life-at-arm's-length in the film seem irritatingly transparent . 
0		waydowntown may not be an important movie , or even a good one , but it provides a nice change of mindless pace in collision with the hot oscar season currently underway . 
0		lame , haphazard teen comedy . 
0		it's sweet , harmless , dumb , occasionally funny and about as compelling as a fishing show . 
0		as we have come to learn -- as many times as we have fingers to count on -- jason is a killer who doesn't know the meaning of the word 'quit . ' the filmmakers might want to look it up . 
0		the only type of lives this glossy comedy-drama resembles are ones in formulaic mainstream movies . 
0		with or without ballast tanks , k-19 sinks to a harrison ford low . 
0		one senses in world traveler and in his earlier film that freundlich bears a grievous but obscure complaint against fathers , and circles it obsessively , without making contact . 
0		one of those films that started with a great premise and then just fell apart . 
0		the action is reasonably well-done . . . yet story , character and comedy bits are too ragged to ever fit smoothly together . 
0		the film's tone and pacing are off almost from the get-go . 
0		mushes the college-friends genre ( the big chill ) together with the contrivances and overwrought emotion of soap operas . 
0		a semi-autobiographical film that's so sloppily written and cast that you cannot believe anyone more central to the creation of bugsy than the caterer had anything to do with it . 
0		loud , silly , stupid and pointless . 
0		the movie just has too much on its plate to really stay afloat for its just under ninety minute running time . 
0		priggish , lethargically paced parable of renewal . 
0		in execution , this clever idea is far less funny than the original , killers from space . 
0		nearly every attempt at humor here is doa . 
0		there's a solid woman- finding-herself story somewhere in here , but you'd have to dig pretty deep to uncover it . 
0		a clichéd and shallow cautionary tale about the hard-partying lives of gay men . 
0		billy crystal and robert de niro sleepwalk through vulgarities in a sequel you can refuse . 
0		if h . g . wells had a time machine and could take a look at his kin's reworked version , what would he say ? 'it looks good , sonny , but you missed the point . '
0		though this rude and crude film does deliver a few gut-busting laughs , its digs at modern society are all things we've seen before . 
0		the movie's plot is almost entirely witless and inane , carrying every gag two or three times beyond its limit to sustain a laugh . 
0		they presume their audience won't sit still for a sociology lesson , however entertainingly presented , so they trot out the conventional science-fiction elements of bug-eyed monsters and futuristic women in skimpy clothes .

0		if only it were , well , funnier . 
0		those eternally devoted to the insanity of black will have an intermittently good time . feel free to go get popcorn whenever he's not onscreen . 
0		this story of unrequited love doesn't sustain interest beyond the first half-hour . 
0		like leafing through an album of photos accompanied by the sketchiest of captions . 
0		[director] o'fallon manages to put some lovely pictures up on the big screen , but his skill at telling a story -- he also contributed to the screenplay -- falls short . 
0		the last three narcissists left on earth compete for each others' affections . 
0		solaris " is a shapeless inconsequential move relying on the viewer to do most of the work . 
0		great story , bad idea for a movie . 
0		strong setup and ambitious goals fade as the film descends into unsophisticated scare tactics and b-film thuggery . 
0		this movie . . . doesn't deserve the energy it takes to describe how bad it is . 
0		a very slow , uneventful ride around a pretty tattered old carousel . 
0		hardman is a grating , mannered onscreen presence , which is especially unfortunate in light of the fine work done by most of the rest of her cast . 
0		when the screenwriter responsible for one of the worst movies of one year directs an equally miserable film the following year , you'd have a hard time believing it was just coincidence . 
0		plotless collection of moronic stunts is by far the worst movie of the year . 
0		in exactly 89 minutes , most of which passed as slowly as if i'd been sitting naked on an igloo , formula 51 sank from quirky to jerky to utter turkey .

0		it's tough to be startled when you're almost dozing . 
0		fans of the tv series will be disappointed , and everyone else will be slightly bored . 
0		[u]nrelentingly stupid . 
0		there's more repetition than creativity throughout the movie . 
0		as violent , profane and exploitative as the most offensive action flick you've ever seen . 
0		it's a film that hinges on its casting , and glover really doesn't fit the part . 
0		the twist that ends the movie is the one with the most emotional resonance , but twists are getting irritating , and this is the kind of material where the filmmakers should be very careful about raising eyebrows . 
0		the story is -- forgive me -- a little thin , and the filmmaking clumsy and rushed . 
0		when seagal appeared in an orange prison jumpsuit , i wanted to stand up in the theater and shout , 'hey , kool-aid ! '

0		there's a reason the studio didn't offer an advance screening . " the adventures of pluto nash " is a big time stinker . 
0		what's missing is what we call the 'wow' factor . 
0		there's too much forced drama in this wildly uneven movie , about a young man's battle with his inescapable past and uncertain future in a very shapable but largely unfulfilling present . 
0		a bland animated sequel that hardly seems worth the effort . 
0		the whole thing's fairly lame , making it par for the course for disney sequels .

0		i wonder what the reaction of israelis will be to this supposedly evenhanded presentation . 
0		this film is so slick , superficial and trend-hoppy , that it's easy to imagine that a new software program spit out the screenplay . 
0		rollerball is as bad as you think , and worse than you can imagine . 
0		the story has its redundancies , and the young actors , not very experienced , are sometimes inexpressive . 
0		an afterschool special without the courage of its convictions . 
0		feels shrill , simple and soapy . 
0		sounding like arnold schwarzenegger , with a physique to match , [ahola] has a wooden delivery and encounters a substantial arc of change that doesn't produce any real transformation . 
0		the obligatory break-ups and hook-ups don't seem to have much emotional impact on the characters . 
0		there is so much plodding sensitivity . 
0		this is the kind of movie during which you want to bang your head on the seat in front of you , at its cluelessness , at its idiocy , at its utterly misplaced earnestness . 
0		the movie resolutely avoids all the comic possibilities of its situation , and becomes one more dumb high school comedy about sex gags and prom dates . 
0		as it abruptly crosscuts among the five friends , it fails to lend the characters' individual stories enough dramatic resonance to make us care about them . 
0		drags along in a dazed and enervated , drenched-in-the- past numbness . 
0		while american adobo has its heart ( and its palate ) in the right place , its brain is a little scattered -- ditsy , even . 
0		cedar somewhat defuses this provocative theme by submerging it in a hoary love triangle . 
0		the redeeming feature of chan's films has always been the action , but the stunts in the tuxedo seem tired and , what's worse , routine . 
0		this is a movie so insecure about its capacity to excite that it churns up not one but two flagrantly fake thunderstorms to underscore the action . 
0		what starts off as a possible argentine american beauty reeks like a room stacked with pungent flowers . 
0		seriously , rent the disney version . 
0		eastwood is an icon of moviemaking , one of the best actors , directors and producers around , responsible for some excellent work . but even a hero can stumble sometimes . 
0		the movie , while beautiful , feels labored , with a hint of the writing exercise about it . 
0		on top of a foundering performance , [madonna's] denied her own athleticism by lighting that emphasizes every line and sag . 
0		this is not one of the movies you'd want to watch if you only had a week to live . 
0		claims to sort the bad guys from the good , which is its essential problem . 
0		though howard demonstrates a great eye as a director , this southern gothic drama is sadly a tough sit , with an undeveloped narrative and enough flashbacks and heavy-handed metaphors to choke a horse -- or at least slow him down to a canter . 
0		 . . . grows decidedly flimsier with its many out-sized , out of character and logically porous action set pieces . 
0		a movie that tries to fuse the two 'woods' but winds up a bolly-holly masala mess . 
0		hey arnold ! is now stretched to barely feature length , with a little more attention paid to the animation . still , the updated dickensian sensibility of writer craig bartlett's story is appealing . 
0		i wish it would have just gone more over-the-top instead of trying to have it both ways . 
0		this film was made to get laughs from the slowest person in the audience -- just pure slapstick with lots of inane , inoffensive screaming and exaggerated facial expressions . 
0		curling may be a unique sport but men with brooms is distinctly ordinary . 
0		for all the time we spend with these people , we never really get inside of them .

0		despite some comic sparks , welcome to collinwood never catches fire . 
0		just plain silly . 
0		 . . . may work as an addictive guilty pleasure but the material never overcomes its questionable satirical ambivalence . this scarlet's letter is a . . . as in aimless , arduous , and arbitrary . 
0		with nary a glimmer of self-knowledge , [crane] becomes more specimen than character -- and auto focus remains a chilly , clinical lab report .

0		if you liked the 1982 film then , you'll still like it now . 
0		not good enough to pass for a litmus test of the generation gap and not bad enough to repulse any generation of its fans . 
0		schindler's list it ain't . 
0		walter hill's pulpy , stylized boxing melodrama undisputed nearly overcomes its questionable in-the-ring match-up with solid fight choreography and gritty prison authenticity . 
0		what you would end up with if you took orwell , bradbury , kafka , george lucas and the wachowski brothers and threw them into a blender . but that's just the problem with it - the director hasn't added enough of his own ingredients .

0		a whimsical if predictable time-travel fable marred by a willful single-mindedness . 
0		at best this is a film for the under-7 crowd . but it would be better to wait for the video . and a very rainy day . 
0		elegantly crafted but emotionally cold , a puzzle whose intricate construction one can admire but is difficult to connect with on any deeper level .

0		silly stuff , all mixed up together like a term paper from a kid who can't quite distinguish one sci-fi work from another . 
0		it's difficult to imagine that a more confused , less interesting and more sloppily made film could possibly come down the road in 2002 .

0		return to neverland manages to straddle the line between another classic for the company and just another run-of-the-mill disney sequel intended for the home video market . 
0		seemingly disgusted with the lazy material and the finished product's unshapely look , director fisher stevens inexplicably dips key moments from the film in waking life water colors . 
0		in the not-too-distant future , movies like ghost ship will be used as analgesic balm for overstimulated minds . right now , they're merely signposts marking the slow , lingering death of imagination . 
0		a lot like the imaginary sport it projects onto the screen -- loud , violent and mindless . 
0		as an actor's showcase , hart's war has much to recommend it , even if the top-billed willis is not the most impressive player . as a story of dramatic enlightenment , the screenplay by billy ray and terry george leaves something to be desired . 
0		the movie is a mess from start to finish .

0		such a bad movie that its luckiest viewers will be seated next to one of those ignorant pinheads who talk throughout the show .

0		this pathetic junk is barely an hour long . nevertheless , it still seems endless . 
0		what's missing in murder by numbers is any real psychological grounding for the teens' deviant behaviour . being latently gay and liking to read are hardly enough . 
0		festers in just such a dungpile that you'd swear you were watching monkeys flinging their feces at you .

0		stupid , infantile , redundant , sloppy , over-the-top , and amateurish . yep , it's " waking up in reno . " go back to sleep . 
0		the movie makes absolutely no sense . its underlying mythology is a hodgepodge of inconsistencies that pose the question : since when did dumb entertainment have to be this dumb ? 
0		as is often the case with ambitious , eager first-time filmmakers , mr . murray , a prolific director of music videos , stuffs his debut with more plot than it can comfortably hold . 
0		like a grinning jack o' lantern , its apparent glee is derived from a lobotomy , having had all its vital essence scooped out and discarded . 
0		a straight-ahead thriller that never rises above superficiality .

0		nothing plot-wise is worth e-mailing home about . 
0		the lousy lead performances . . . keep the movie from ever reaching the comic heights it obviously desired . 
0		millions of dollars heaped upon a project of such vast proportions need to reap more rewards than spiffy bluescreen technique and stylish weaponry . 
0		let's hope -- shall we ? -- that the 'true story' by which all the queen's men is allegedly " inspired " was a lot funnier and more deftly enacted than what's been cobbled together onscreen . 
0		it's so crammed with scenes and vistas and pretty moments that it's left a few crucial things out , like character development and coherence . 
0		the result is an 'action film' mired in stasis . 
0		a dreary movie .

0		it's absolutely amazing how first-time director kevin donovan managed to find something new to add to the canon of chan . make chan's action sequences boring . 
0		where last time jokes flowed out of cho's life story , which provided an engrossing dramatic through line , here the comedian hides behind obviously constructed routines . 
0		a morality tale whose thought-provoking potential is hampered by a made-for-tv look , rigid performances and an asinine 'twist' that brazenly rips off the sixth sense . 
0		looks more like a travel-agency video targeted at people who like to ride bikes topless and roll in the mud than a worthwhile glimpse of independent-community guiding lights .

0		it desperately wants to be a wacky , screwball comedy , but the most screwy thing here is how so many talented people were convinced to waste their time . 
0		 . . . the sum of the parts equals largely a confused mediocrity . 
0		as a feature-length film , it wears out its welcome as tryingly as the title character . 
0		just a kiss is a just a waste . 
0		freundlich's made [crudup] a suburban architect , and a cipher .

0		collateral damage is , despite its alleged provocation post-9/11 , an antique , in the end . as are its star , its attitude and its obliviousness . 
0		the makers of divine secrets of the ya-ya sisterhood should offer a free ticket ( second prize , of course , two free tickets ) to anyone who can locate a genuinely honest moment in their movie .

0		'enigma' is a good name for a movie this delibrately obtuse and unapproachable . a waste of good performances . 
0		girlfriends are bad , wives are worse and babies are the kiss of death in this bitter italian comedy . 
0		[i]t's certainly laudable that the movie deals with hot-button issues in a comedic context , but barbershop isn't as funny as it should be . 
0		a movie that's about as overbearing and over-the-top as the family it depicts . 
0		this is the sort of low-grade dreck that usually goes straight to video --with a lousy script , inept direction , pathetic acting , poorly dubbed dialogue and murky cinematography , complete with visible boom mikes . 
0		has a customarily jovial air but a deficit of flim-flam inventiveness . 
0		i'm not sure which is worse : the poor acting by the ensemble cast , the flat dialogue by vincent r . nebrida or the gutless direction by laurice guillen . 
0		sticky sweet sentimentality , clumsy plotting and a rosily myopic view of life in the wwii-era mississippi delta undermine this adaptation . 
0		`hey arnold ! ' has some visual wit . . . but little imagination elsewhere .

0		maybe leblanc thought , " hey , the movie about the baseball-playing monkey was worse . " 
0		just another disjointed , fairly predictable psychological thriller . 
0		a sub-formulaic slap in the face to seasonal cheer . 
0		when a movie asks you to feel sorry for mick jagger's sex life , it already has one strike against it . 
0		turns a potentially interesting idea into an excruciating film school experience that plays better only for the film's publicists or for people who take as many drugs as the film's characters
0		a valueless kiddie paean to pro basketball underwritten by the nba . 
0		[t]he film is never sure to make a clear point  even if it seeks to rely on an ambiguous presentation . 
0		somewhere inside the mess that is world traveler , there is a mediocre movie trying to get out . 
0		once one experiences mr . haneke's own sadistic tendencies toward his audience , one is left with a sour taste in one's mouth , and little else . 
0		like a medium-grade network sitcom--mostly inoffensive , fitfully amusing , but ultimately so weightless that a decent draft in the auditorium might blow it off the screen . 
0		adults will certainly want to spend their time in the theater thinking up grocery lists and ways to tell their kids how not to act like pinocchio . as for children , they won't enjoy the movie at all . 
0		the whole talking-animal thing is grisly . 
0		the film is all over the place , really . it dabbles all around , never gaining much momentum . 
0		really dumb but occasionally really funny . 
0		bread , my sweet has so many flaws it would be easy for critics to shred it . it may even fall into the category of films you love to hate . i admit it , i hate to like it . 
0		the explosion essentially ruined -- or , rather , overpowered -- the fiction of the movie for me . 
0		isn't it a bit early in his career for director barry sonnenfeld to do a homage to himself ? and it's a lousy one at that . 
0		make no mistake , ivans xtc . is a mess . 
0		every sequel you skip will be two hours gained . consider this review life-affirming . 
0		bears about as much resemblance to the experiences of most battered women as spider-man does to the experiences of most teenagers . 
0		the only entertainment you'll derive from this choppy and sloppy affair will be from unintentional giggles  several of them . 
0		 . . . built on the premise that middle-class arkansas consists of monster truck-loving good ol' boys and peroxide blond honeys whose worldly knowledge comes from tv reruns and supermarket tabloids . 
0		stale first act , scrooge story , blatant product placement , some very good comedic songs , strong finish , dumb fart jokes . 
0		the lousy john q all but spits out denzel washington's fine performance in the title role . 
0		j . lo will earn her share of the holiday box office pie , although this movie makes one thing perfectly clear : she's a pretty woman , but she's no working girl . 
0		despite the authenticity of the trappings , the film is overblown in its plotting , hackneyed in its dialogue and anachronistic in its style . 
0		what's the most positive thing that can be said about the new rob schneider vehicle ? well , it's not as pathetic as the animal . 
0		busy urban comedy is clearly not zhang's forte , his directorial touch is neither light nor magical enough to bring off this kind of whimsy . 
0		ihops don't pile on this much syrup . 
0		sheridan . . . smoothes over sources of conflict that could have lent the film a bit more depth . 
0		an undistinguished attempt to make a classic theater piece cinematic . 
0		tiresomely derivative and hammily acted . 
0		despite some gulps the film is a fuzzy huggy . 
0		it all seemed wasted like deniro's once promising career and the once grand long beach boardwalk . 
0		though perry and hurley make inspiring efforts to breathe life into the disjointed , haphazard script by jay scherick and david ronn , neither the actors nor director reginald hudlin can make it more than fitfully entertaining . 
0		in a big corner office in hell , satan is throwing up his hands in surrender , is firing his r&d people , and has decided he will just screen the master of disguise 24/7 . 
0		the director has injected self-consciousness into the proceedings at every turn . the results are far more alienating than involving . 
0		'you'll laugh for not quite and hour and a half , but come out feeling strangely unsatisfied . you'll feel like you ate a reeses without the peanut butter . . . '
0		a low-budget affair , tadpole was shot on digital video , and the images often look smeary and blurry , to the point of distraction . then again , in a better movie , you might not have noticed . 
0		i can't say this enough : this movie is about an adult male dressed in pink jammies . 
0		most of the storylines feel like time fillers between surf shots . the movie isn't horrible , but you can see mediocre cresting on the next wave . 
0		a full-frontal attack on audience patience . 
0		 " looking for leonard " just seems to kinda sit in neutral , hoping for a stiff wind to blow it uphill or something . 
0		christina ricci comedy about sympathy , hypocrisy and love is a misfire . 
0		by-the-numbers yarn . 
0		this is the type of movie best enjoyed by frat boys and college kids while sucking on the bong and downing one alcoholic beverage after another . 
0		the whole film has this sneaky feel to it  as if the director is trying to dupe the viewer into taking it all as very important simply because the movie is ugly to look at and not a hollywood product . 
0		a compendium of solondz's own worst instincts in under 90 minutes . 
0		national lampoon's van wilder could be the worst thing to come out of national lampoon since class reunion
0		demme gets a lot of flavor and spice into his charade remake , but he can't disguise that he's spiffing up leftovers that aren't so substantial or fresh . 
0		though avary has done his best to make something out of ellis' nothing novel , in the end , his rules is barely worth following . 
0		taken purely as an exercise in style , this oppressively gloomy techno-horror clambake is impossible to ignore . but as a movie , it's a humorless , disjointed mess . 
0		 . . . turns so unforgivably trite in its last 10 minutes that anyone without a fortified sweet tooth will likely go into sugar shock . 
0		 " the tuxedo " should have been the vehicle for chan that " the mask " was for jim carrey . alas , it's the man that makes the clothes . 
0		how inept is serving sara ? it makes even elizabeth hurley seem graceless and ugly . 
0		it's hard to believe these jokers are supposed to have pulled off four similar kidnappings before . 
0		given the fact that virtually no one is bound to show up at theatres for it , the project should have been made for the tube . 
0		they ought to be a whole lot scarier than they are in this tepid genre offering . 
0		deadeningly dull , mired in convoluted melodrama , nonsensical jargon and stiff-upper-lip laboriousness . 
0		'yes , that's right : it's forrest gump , angel of death . '
0		[green is] the comedy equivalent of saddam hussein , and i'm just about ready to go to the u . n . and ask permission for a preemptive strike . 
0		an infuriating film . just when you think you are making sense of it , something happens that tells you there is no sense . 
0		we've liked klein's other work but rollerball left us cold . 
0		its and pieces of the hot chick are so hilarious , and schneider's performance is so fine , it's a real shame that so much of the movie -- again , as in the animal -- is a slapdash mess . 
0		this is a great subject for a movie , but hollywood has squandered the opportunity , using it as a prop for warmed-over melodrama and the kind of choreographed mayhem that director john woo has built his career on . 
0		though the opera itself takes place mostly indoors , jacquot seems unsure of how to evoke any sort of naturalism on the set . 
0		feels like six different movies fighting each other for attention . 
0		a mix of velocity and idiocy , this ruinous remake lacks the brawn -- and the brains -- of the 1970s original . 
0		a so-so , made-for-tv something posing as a real movie . 
0		nothing but an episode of smackdown ! in period costume and with a bigger budget . 
0		due to some script weaknesses and the casting of the director's brother , the film trails off into inconsequentiality . 
0		although there are several truly jolting scares , there's also an abundance of hackneyed dialogue and more silly satanic business than you can shake a severed limb at . 
0		more tiring than anything . 
0		this is very much of a mixed bag , with enough negatives to outweigh the positives . 
0		diaz , applegate , blair and posey are suitably kooky which should appeal to women and they strip down often enough to keep men alert , if not amused . 
0		culkin turns his character into what is basically an anti-harry potter -- right down to the gryffindor scarf . 
0		a tv style murder mystery with a few big screen moments ( including one that seems to be made for a different film altogether ) . 
0		the script is a disaster , with cloying messages and irksome characters . 
0		this slender plot feels especially thin stretched over the nearly 80-minute running time . 
0		a movie that's held captive by mediocrity . not bad , but not all that good . bacon keeps things interesting , but don't go out of your way to pay full price . 
0		the plot is plastered with one hollywood cliche after another , most of which involve precocious kids getting the better of obnoxious adults . 
0		the acting is stiff , the story lacks all trace of wit , the sets look like they were borrowed from gilligan's island -- and the cgi scooby might well be the worst special-effects creation of the year . 
0		the film is really not so much bad as bland . 
0		like its script , which nurses plot holes gaping enough to pilot an entire olympic swim team through , the characters in swimfan seem motivated by nothing short of dull , brain-deadening hangover . 
0		the sweetest thing leaves an awful sour taste . 
0		serving sara doesn't serve up a whole lot of laughs . 
0		feels less like it's about teenagers , than it was written by teenagers . 
0		unfortunately , a cast of competent performers from movies , television and the theater are cast adrift in various new york city locations with no unifying rhythm or visual style . 
0		an overblown clunker full of bad jokes , howling cliches and by-the-numbers action sequences . 
0		 . . . the film suffers from a lack of humor ( something needed to balance out the violence ) . . . 
0		we never truly come to care about the main characters and whether or not they'll wind up together , and michele's spiritual quest is neither amusing nor dramatic enough to sustain interest . 
0		this is a poster movie , a mediocre tribute to films like them ! 
0		the action scenes have all the suspense of a 20-car pileup , while the plot holes are big enough for a train car to drive through -- if kaos hadn't blown them all up . 
0		the director seems to take an unseemly pleasure in [the characters'] misery and at the same time to congratulate himself for having the guts to confront it . 
0		77 minutes of pokemon may not last 4ever , it just seems like it does . my only wish is that celebi could take me back to a time before i saw this movie and i could just skip it . 
0		if you've got a house full of tots -- don't worry , this will be on video long before they grow up and you can wait till then . 
0		bolstered by an astonishing voice cast ( excepting love hewitt ) , an interesting racial tension , and a storyline that i haven't encountered since at least pete's dragon . 
0		soul is what's lacking in every character in this movie and , subsequently , the movie itself . 
0		by the end , you just don't care whether that cold-hearted snake petrovich ( that would be reno ) gets his comeuppance . just bring on the battle bots , please ! 
0		there's an excellent 90-minute film here ; unfortunately , it runs for 170 . 
0		a sermonizing and lifeless paean to teenage dullards . 
0		like most sequels , it takes what worked last time , repeats it and adds more characters , more stunts , more stuff in attempt to camouflage its sameness . 
0		it should be mentioned that the set design and interiors of the haunted vessel are more than effectively creepy and moodily lit . so i just did . 
0		human nature , in short , isn't nearly as funny as it thinks it is ; neither is it as smart . 
0		it's kind of sad that so many people put so much time and energy into this turkey . 
0		a cellophane-pop remake of the punk classic ladies and gentlemen , the fabulous stains . . . crossroads is never much worse than bland or better than inconsequential . 
0		an ugly , pointless , stupid movie . 
0		it's hard to care about a film that proposes as epic tragedy the plight of a callow rich boy who is forced to choose between his beautiful , self-satisfied 22-year-old girlfriend and an equally beautiful , self-satisfied 18-year-old mistress . 
0		it's a bad sign in a thriller when you instantly know whodunit . 
0		the humor is forced and heavy-handed , and occasionally simply unpleasant . 
0		the three leads produce adequate performances , but what's missing from this material is any depth of feeling . 
0		this romantic/comedy asks the question how much souvlaki can you take before indigestion sets in . 
0		those of you who are not an eighth grade girl will most likely doze off during this one . 
0		this one is a few bits funnier than malle's dud , if only because the cast is so engagingly messing around like slob city reductions of damon runyon crooks . 
0		less about shakespeare than the spawn of fools who saw quentin tarantino's handful of raucous gangster films and branched out into their own pseudo-witty copycat interpretations . 
0		sometimes there are very , very good reasons for certain movies to be sealed in a jar and left on a remote shelf indefinitely . 
0		very much a home video , and so devoid of artifice and purpose that it appears not to have been edited at all . 
0		for something as splendid-looking as this particular film , the viewer expects something special but instead gets [sci-fi] rehash . 
0		fans of plympton's shorts may marginally enjoy the film , but it is doubtful this listless feature will win him any new viewers . 
0		everything else about high crimes is , like the military system of justice it portrays , tiresomely regimented . 
0		i like my christmas movies with more elves and snow and less pimps and ho's . 
0		no one involved , save dash , shows the slightest aptitude for acting , and the script , credited to director abdul malik abbott and ernest 'tron' anderson , seems entirely improvised . 
0		high crimes is a cinematic misdemeanor , a routine crime thriller remarkable only for its lack of logic and misuse of two fine actors , morgan freeman and ashley judd . 
0		the film never gets over its own investment in conventional arrangements , in terms of love , age , gender , race , and class . 
0		tends to plod . 
0		not a bad premise , but the execution is lackluster at best . 
0		has all the values of a straight-to-video movie , but because it has a bigger-name cast , it gets a full theatrical release . 
0		like being trapped inside a huge video game , where exciting , inane images keep popping past your head and the same illogical things keep happening over and over again . 
0		the screenplay by james eric , james horton and director peter o'fallon . . . is so pat it makes your teeth hurt . 
0		mckay shows crushingly little curiosity about , or is ill-equipped to examine , the interior lives of the characters in his film , much less incorporate them into his narrative . 
0		enough trivializes an important crisis , reduces it to an almost comic embarrassment . 
0		an imponderably stilted and self-consciously arty movie . 
0		typical animé , with cheapo animation ( like saturday morning tv in the '60s ) , a complex sword-and-sorcery plot and characters who all have big round eyes and japanese names . 
0		spirit is a visual treat , and it takes chances that are bold by studio standards , but it lacks a strong narrative . 
0		so devoid of pleasure or sensuality that it cannot even be dubbed hedonistic . 
0		helmer devito . . . attempts to do too many things in this story about ethics , payola , vice , murder , kids' tv and revenge . 
0		will probably stay in the shadow of its two older , more accessible qatsi siblings . 
0		don't waste your money . 
0		poor ben bratt couldn't find stardom if mapquest emailed him point-to-point driving directions . 
0		if jews were catholics , this would be catechism
0		 . . . hopefully it'll be at the dollar theatres by the time christmas rolls around . wait to see it then . 
0		just a collection of this and that -- whatever fills time -- with no unified whole . 
0		behan's memoir is great material for a film -- rowdy , brawny and lyrical in the best irish sense -- but sheridan has settled for a lugubrious romance . 
0		this is a third-person story now , told by hollywood , and much more ordinary for it . 
0		everything -- even life on an aircraft carrier -- is sentimentalized . 
0		scotland , pa is entirely too straight-faced to transcend its clever concept . 
0		it takes a really long , slow and dreary time to dope out what tuck everlasting is about . so here it is : it's about a family of sour immortals . 
0		plodding , peevish and gimmicky . 
0		i like it . no , i hate it . no , i love it . . . hell , i dunno . 
0		whenever its story isn't bogged down by idiocy involving the cia and a lost u . s . satellite , hunter -- starring irwin and his american wife/colleague , terri -- is a movie children should enjoy . 
0		a boring , wincingly cute and nauseatingly politically correct cartoon guaranteed to drive anyone much over age 4 screaming from the theater . 
0		this low-rent -- and even lower-wit -- rip-off of the farrelly brothers' oeuvre gets way too mushy -- and in a relatively short amount of time . 
0		a distinctly minor effort that will be seen to better advantage on cable , especially considering its barely feature-length running time of one hour . 
0		was that movie nothing more than a tepid exercise in trotting out a formula that worked five years ago but has since lost its fizz ? 
0		there's a bit of thematic meat on the bones of queen of the damned , as its origins in an anne rice novel dictate , but generally , it's a movie that emphasizes style over character and substance . 
0		deserving of its critical backlash and more . 
0		who needs love like this ? 
0		rife with nutty cliches and far too much dialogue .

1		thirteen conversations about one thing lays out a narrative puzzle that interweaves individual stories , and , like a mobius strip , elliptically loops back to where it began .
